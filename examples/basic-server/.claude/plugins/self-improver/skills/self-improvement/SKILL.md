# Self-Improvement Skill

This skill contains knowledge about how to identify and implement improvements to the self-improver agent.

## Improvement Categories

### 1. Pattern Recognition Improvements

When analyzing code, track:
- Common issues that are frequently flagged
- Patterns that users ask about repeatedly
- Edge cases that are often missed

### 2. Response Quality Improvements

Consider:
- Are explanations clear and concise?
- Are code examples accurate and idiomatic?
- Is the level of detail appropriate?

### 3. Workflow Improvements

Look for:
- Steps that could be automated
- Common sequences of operations
- Error-prone manual steps

## Current Improvement Log

_This section tracks improvements that have been implemented._

- Initial version created

## Pending Improvement Ideas

_Ideas that are being considered but not yet implemented._

- None yet - the agent will add ideas here as it identifies them

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: When suggesting improvements, include concrete examples
2. **Be conservative**: Only suggest changes you're confident will help
3. **Test first**: Mentally trace through how changes would affect behavior
4. **Document why**: Always explain the reasoning behind improvements
